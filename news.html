    // Define an array of words
    const words = ['Daniel Greenfield, a Shillman Journalism Fellow at the Freedom Center, is a New York writer focusing on radical Islam. \r\nIn the final stretch of the election, Hillary Rodham Clinton has gone to war with the FBI. \r\nThe word â€œunprecedentedâ€ has been thrown around so often this election that it ought to be retired. But itâ€™s still unprecedented for the nominee of a major political party to go war with the FBI. \r\nBut thatâ€™s exactly what Hillary and her people have done. Coma patients just waking up now and watching an hour of CNN from their hospital beds would assume that FBI Director James Comey is Hillaryâ€™s opponent in this election. \r\nThe FBI is under attack by everyone from Obama to CNN. Hillaryâ€™s people have circulated a letter attacking Comey. There are currently more media hit pieces lambasting him than targeting Trump. It wouldnâ€™t be too surprising if the Clintons or their allies were to start running attack ads against the FBI. \r\nThe FBIâ€™s leadership is being warned that the entire left-wing establishment will form a lynch mob if they continue going after Hillary. And the FBIâ€™s credibility is being attacked by the media and the Democrats to preemptively head off the results of the investigation of the Clinton Foundation and Hillary Clinton. \r\nThe covert struggle between FBI agents and Obamaâ€™s DOJ people has gone explosively public. \r\nThe New York Times has compared Comey to J. Edgar Hoover. Its bizarre headline, â€œJames Comey Role Recalls Hooverâ€™s FBI, Fairly or Notâ€ practically admits up front that itâ€™s spouting nonsense. The Boston Globe has published a column calling for Comeyâ€™s resignation. Not to be outdone, Time has an editorial claiming that the scandal is really an attack on all women. \r\nJames Carville appeared on MSNBC to remind everyone that he was still alive and insane. He accused Comey of coordinating with House Republicans and the KGB. And you thought the â€œvast right wing conspiracyâ€ was a stretch. \r\nCountless media stories charge Comey with violating procedure. Do you know whatâ€™s a procedural violation? Emailing classified information stored on your bathroom server. \r\nSenator Harry Reid has sent Comey a letter accusing him of violating the Hatch Act. The Hatch Act is a nice idea that has as much relevance in the age of Obama as the Tenth Amendment. But the cable news spectrum quickly filled with media hacks glancing at the Wikipedia article on the Hatch Act under the table while accusing the FBI director of one of the most awkward conspiracies against Hillary ever. \r\nIf James Comey is really out to hurt Hillary, he picked one hell of a strange way to do it. \r\nNot too long ago Democrats were breathing a sigh of relief when he gave Hillary Clinton a pass in a prominent public statement. If he really were out to elect Trump by keeping the email scandal going, why did he trash the investigation? Was he on the payroll of House Republicans and the KGB back then and playing it coy or was it a sudden development where Vladimir Putin and Paul Ryan talked him into taking a look at Anthony Weinerâ€™s computer? \r\nEither Comey is the most cunning FBI director that ever lived or heâ€™s just awkwardly trying to navigate a political mess that has trapped him between a DOJ leadership whose political futures are tied to Hillaryâ€™s victory and his own bureau whose apolitical agents just want to be allowed to do their jobs. \r\nThe only truly mysterious thing is why Hillary and her associates decided to go to war with a respected Federal agency. Most Americans like the FBI while Hillary Clinton enjoys a 60% unfavorable rating. \r\nAnd itâ€™s an interesting question. \r\nHillaryâ€™s old strategy was to lie and deny that the FBI even had a criminal investigation underway. Instead her associates insisted that it was a security review. The FBI corrected her and she shrugged it off. But the old breezy denial approach has given way to a savage assault on the FBI. \r\nPretending that nothing was wrong was a bad strategy, but it was a better one that picking a fight with the FBI while lunatic Clinton associates try to claim that the FBI is really the KGB. \r\nThere are two possible explanations. \r\nHillary Clinton might be arrogant enough to lash out at the FBI now that she believes that victory is near. The same kind of hubris that led her to plan her victory fireworks display could lead her to declare a war on the FBI for irritating her during the final miles of her campaign. \r\nBut the other explanation is that her people panicked. \r\nGoing to war with the FBI is not the behavior of a smart and focused presidential campaign. Itâ€™s an act of desperation. When a presidential candidate decides that her only option is to try and destroy the credibility of the FBI, thatâ€™s not hubris, itâ€™s fear of what the FBI might be about to reveal about her. \r\nDuring the original FBI investigation, Hillary Clinton was confident that she could ride it out. And she had good reason for believing that. But that Hillary Clinton is gone. In her place is a paranoid wreck. Within a short space of time the â€œpositiveâ€ Clinton campaign promising to unite the country has been replaced by a desperate and flailing operation that has focused all its energy on fighting the FBI. \r\nThereâ€™s only one reason for such bizarre behavior. \r\nThe Clinton campaign has decided that an FBI investigation of the latest batch of emails poses a threat to its survival. And so itâ€™s gone all in on fighting the FBI. Itâ€™s an unprecedented step born of fear. Itâ€™s hard to know whether that fear is justified. But the existence of that fear already tells us a whole lot. \r\nClinton loyalists rigged the old investigation. They knew the outcome ahead of time as well as they knew the debate questions. Now suddenly they are no longer in control. And they are afraid. \r\nYou can smell the fear. \r\nThe FBI has wiretaps from the investigation of the Clinton Foundation. Itâ€™s finding new emails all the time. And Clintonworld panicked. The spinmeisters of Clintonworld have claimed that the email scandal is just so much smoke without fire. All thatâ€™s here is the appearance of impropriety without any of the substance. But this isnâ€™t how you react to smoke. Itâ€™s how you respond to a fire. \r\nThe misguided assault on the FBI tells us that Hillary Clinton and her allies are afraid of a revelation bigger than the fundamental illegality of her email setup. The email setup was a preemptive cover up. The Clinton campaign has panicked badly out of the belief, right or wrong, that whatever crime the illegal setup was meant to cover up is at risk of being exposed. \r\nThe Clintons have weathered countless scandals over the years. Whatever they are protecting this time around is bigger than the usual corruption, bribery, sexual assaults and abuses of power that have followed them around throughout the years. This is bigger and more damaging than any of the allegations that have already come out. And they donâ€™t want FBI investigators anywhere near it. \r\nThe campaign against Comey is pure intimidation. Itâ€™s also a warning. Any senior FBI people who value their careers are being warned to stay away. The Democrats are closing ranks around their nominee against the FBI. Itâ€™s an ugly and unprecedented scene. It may also be their last stand. \r\nHillary Clinton has awkwardly wound her way through numerous scandals in just this election cycle. But sheâ€™s never shown fear or desperation before. Now that has changed. Whatever she is afraid of, it lies buried in her emails with Huma Abedin. And it can bring her down like nothing else has.',
                    'Google Pinterest Digg Linkedin Reddit Stumbleupon Print Delicious Pocket Tumblr \r\nThere are two fundamental truths in this world: Paul Ryan desperately wants to be president. And Paul Ryan will never be president. Today proved it. \r\nIn a particularly staggering example of political cowardice, Paul Ryan re-re-re-reversed course and announced that he was back on the Trump Train after all. This was an aboutface from where he was a few weeks ago. He had previously declared he would not be supporting or defending Trump after a tape was made public in which Trump bragged about assaulting women. Suddenly, Ryan was appearing at a pro-Trump rally and boldly declaring that he already sent in his vote to make him President of the United States. It was a surreal moment. The figurehead of the Republican Party dosed himself in gasoline, got up on a stage on a chilly afternoon in Wisconsin, and lit a match. . @SpeakerRyan says he voted for @realDonaldTrump : â€œRepublicans, it is time to come homeâ€ https:\/\/t.co\/VyTT49YvoE pic.twitter.com\/wCvSCg4a5I \r\nâ€” ABC News Politics (@ABCPolitics) November 5, 2016 \r\nThe Democratic Party couldnâ€™t have asked for a better moment of film. Ryanâ€™s chances of ever becoming president went down to zero in an instant. In the wreckage Trump is to leave behind in his wake, those who cravenly backed his campaign will not recover. If Ryanâ€™s career manages to limp all the way to 2020, then the DNC will have this tape locked and loaded to be used in every ad until Election Day. \r\nThe ringing endorsement of the man he clearly hates on a personal level speaks volumes about his own spinelessness. Ryan has postured himself as a â€œprincipledâ€ conservative, and one uncomfortable with Trumpâ€™s unapologetic bigotry and sexism. However, when push came to shove, Paul Ryan â€“ like many of his colleagues â€“ turned into a sniveling appeaser. After all his lofty tak about conviction, his principles were a house of cards and collapsed with the slightest breeze. \r\nWhatâ€™s especially bizarre is how close Ryan came to making it through unscathed. For months the Speaker of the House refused to comment on Trump at all. His strategy seemed to be to keep his head down, pretend Trump didnâ€™t exist, and hope that nobody remembered what happened in 2016. Now, just days away from the election, he screwed it all up. \r\nIf 2016â€™s very ugly election has done any good itâ€™s by exposing the utter cowardice of the Republicans who once feigned moral courage. A reality television star spit on them, hijacked their party, insulted their wives, and got every last one of them to kneel before him. What a turn of events. \r\nFeatured image via Twitter',
                    'U.S. Secretary of State John F. Kerry said Monday that he will stop in Paris later this week, amid criticism that no top American officials attended Sundayâ€™s unity march against terrorism.\r\n\r\nKerry said he expects to arrive in Paris Thursday evening, as he heads home after a week abroad. He said he will fly to France at the conclusion of a series of meetings scheduled for Thursday in Sofia, Bulgaria. He plans to meet the next day with Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius and President Francois Hollande, then return to Washington.\r\n\r\nThe visit by Kerry, who has family and childhood ties to the country and speaks fluent French, could address some of the criticism that the United States snubbed France in its darkest hour in many years.\r\n\r\nThe French press on Monday was filled with questions about why neither President Obama nor Kerry attended Sundayâ€™s march, as about 40 leaders of other nations did. Obama was said to have stayed away because his own security needs can be taxing on a country, and Kerry had prior commitments.\r\n\r\nAmong roughly 40 leaders who did attend was Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, no stranger to intense security, who marched beside Hollande through the city streets. The highest ranking U.S. officials attending the march were Jane Hartley, the ambassador to France, and Victoria Nuland, the assistant secretary of state for European affairs. Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. was in Paris for meetings with law enforcement officials but did not participate in the march.\r\n\r\nKerry spent Sunday at a business summit hosted by Indiaâ€™s prime minister, Narendra Modi. The United States is eager for India to relax stringent laws that function as barriers to foreign investment and hopes Modiâ€™s government will act to open the huge Indian market for more American businesses.\r\n\r\nIn a news conference, Kerry brushed aside criticism that the United States had not sent a more senior official to Paris as â€œquibbling a little bit.â€ He noted that many staffers of the American Embassy in Paris attended the march, including the ambassador. He said he had wanted to be present at the march himself but could not because of his prior commitments in India.\r\n\r\nâ€œBut that is why I am going there on the way home, to make it crystal clear how passionately we feel about the events that have taken place there,â€ he said.\r\n\r\nâ€œAnd I donâ€™t think the people of France have any doubts about Americaâ€™s understanding of what happened, of our personal sense of loss and our deep commitment to the people of France in this moment of trauma.â€',
                    'Its primary day in New York and front-runners Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump are leading in the polls.\r\n\r\nTrump is now vowing to win enough delegates to clinch the Republican nomination and prevent a contested convention. But Sens.Ted Cruz, R-Texas, Bernie Sanders, D-Vt., and Ohio Gov. John Kasich and arent giving up just yet.\r\n\r\nA big win in New York could tip the scales for both the Republican and Democratic front-runners in this years race for the White House. Clinton and Trump have each suffered losses in recent contests, shifting the momentum to their rivals.\r\n\r\n\"We have won eight out of the last nine caucuses and primaries! Cheer!\" Sanders recently told supporters.\r\n\r\nWhile wins in New York for Trump and Clinton are expected, the margins of those victories are also important.\r\n\r\nTrump needs to capture more than 50 percent of the vote statewide if he wants to be positioned to win all of the states 95 GOP delegates. That would put him one step closer to avoiding a contested convention.\r\n\r\n\"Weve got to vote and you know Cruz is way, way down in the polls,\" Trump urged supporters.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Sanders is hoping for a close race in the Empire State. A loss by 10 points means hell need to win 80 percent of the remaining delegates to clinch the nomination.\r\n\r\nDespite a predicted loss in New York, Cruz hasnt lost momentum. Hes hoping to sweep up more delegates this weekend while hes talking about how he can win in November.\r\n\r\n\"Because if Im the nominee, we win the General Election,\" Cruz promised his supporters. \"Were beating Hillary in the key swing states, were beating Hillary with Independents, were beating Hillary with young people.\"\r\n\r\nFor now, Cruz, Kasich, and Sanders have all moved on from New York to other states. Trump and Clinton are the only two staying in their home state to watch the results come in.',
                    'Share This Baylee Luciani (left), Screenshot of what Baylee caught on FaceTime (right) \r\nThe closest Baylee Luciani could get to her boyfriend, whoâ€™s attending college in Austin, was through video online chat. The couple had regular â€œdatesâ€ this way to bridge the 200-mile distance between them. However, the endearing arrangement quickly came to an end after his FaceTime was left on and caught something that left his girlfriend horrified. \r\nBaylee had been discussing regular things with her boyfriend, Yale Gerstein, who was on the other side of the screen on an otherwise average evening. This video chat was not unlike all the others she had with Yale from his apartment near Austin Community College until the 19-year-old girlfriend heard some scratching sounds after FaceTime had been left on. \r\nAccording to KRON , Baylee was mid-conversation with Yale when scratches at the door caught both of their attention and he got up from his bed, where the computer was, to see who was at his door. He barely turned the handle to open in when masked men entered the room and beat Yaleâ€™s face in and slammed him down on his bed while shoving a pistol in his cheek. The intruders didnâ€™t seem to know or care that FaceTime was still on and Bayleeâ€™s face, seen in the corner, was watching everything, terrified that she was about to see her boyfriend murdered in front of her, as she watched him fight for his life. \r\nAdmitting that she first thought it was a joke, seconds later, she came to the horrid realization that he was being robbed and called her dad, who was at home with her in Dallas, into the room. â€œI was scared, because they were saying Iâ€™m going to blow your head off, Iâ€™m going to kill you,â€ Baylee explained along with the chilling feeling she got when the intruder finally realized the video chat was running and looked right at her in the camera. â€œIâ€™m like wowâ€¦ seriously watching an armed robbery happen to somebody that I care about,â€ she added. Screengrabs of intruder forcing Yale down on his bed while Baylee and her father watch on FaceTime in horror \r\nWith a clear view of at least one intruderâ€™s face, Baylee began taking screenshots of the suspect in the act as she and her dad called the police to report what was going on. She got the pictures right in time since, seconds later, the intruder decided to disconnect the computer as he and the suspects took off with thousands of dollars worth of Yaleâ€™s music equipment. Although the boyfriendâ€™s life was spared in the traumatizing ordeal for the two of them, he said that the thieves took something from him that canâ€™t be replaced. \r\nâ€œI had just finished my first album as a solo artist,â€ Yale said. â€œThatâ€™s all lost,â€ since they took the recordings on the equipment, which means nothing to the thieves and everything to the victim. Itâ€™s not often that you hear of FaceTime solving crimes or potentially saving lives, which is what happened in this case. Although it was difficult to watch, Baylee, being there through technology, was an instrumental part in protecting Yale, who hopefully learned that he better take advantage of Texasâ€™ great gun laws and arm himself with more than just a computer.',
                    'A Czech stockbroker who saved more than 650 Jewish children from Nazi Germany has died at the age of 106. Dubbed â€œBritainâ€™s Schindler,â€ Nicholas Winton arranged to transport Jewish youngsters from Prague after Germany annexed Czechoslovakia in March 1939. Though the children were originally set to arrive in Britain by plane, the German invasion forced Winton to transport them by train through Germany before they eventually reached England by boat. Winton arranged eight trains, known as the Kindertransports (childrenâ€™s transports), to evacuate the children, and died on the anniversary of the 1939 departure of the one carrying the largest number of children: 241. Winton was knighted by Queen Elizabeth II in 2003 for his efforts, despite keeping it secret for nearly 50 years.',
                    'Iranian negotiators reportedly have made a last-ditch push for more concessions from the U.S. and five other world powers as talks on the fate of Irans nuclear program come down to the final days before a crucial deadline.\r\n\r\nThe New York Times reported late Sunday that Tehran had backed away from a tentative promise to ship a large portion of its uranium stockpile to Russia, where it could not be used as part of any future weapons program. Western officials insisted to the paper that the uranium did not have to be sent overseas, but could be disposed of in other ways.\r\n\r\nThe new twist in the talks comes just two days before the deadline for both sides to agree on a framework for a permanent deal. The final deadline for a permanent deal would not arrive until the end of June.\r\n\r\nHowever, if Iran insists on keeping its uranium in the country, it would undermine a key argument made in favor of the deal by the Obama administration. The Times reports that if the uranium had gone to Russia, it would have been converted into fuel rods, which are difficult to use in nuclear weapons. It is not clear what would happen to the uranium if it remained in Iran.\r\n\r\nThe Associated Press reported Sunday that Irans position had shifted from from demanding that it be allowed to keep nearly 10,000 centrifuges enriching uranium, to agreeing to keep 6,000. Western officials involved in the talks told the Associated Press that Tehran may be ready to accept an even lower number.\r\n\r\nThe United States and its allies want a deal that extends the time Iran would need to make a nuclear weapon from the present two months to three months to at least a year. However, The Times reported Sunday that a paper published by Olli Heinonen, former head of inspections for the U.N.s nuclear watchdog, estimated that Iran could still develop a nuclear weapon in seven or eight months with around 6,500 centrifuges.\r\n\r\nTehran says it wants to enrich uranium only for energy, science, industry and medicine. But many countries fear Iran could use the technology to make weapons-grade uranium.\r\n\r\nOfficials told the Associated Press that another main dispute involved the length of an agreement. Iran, they said, wants a total lifting of all caps on its activities after 10 years, while the U.S. and the five other nations at the talks â€” Russia, China, Britain, France and Germany â€” insist on progressive removal after a decade.\r\n\r\nA senior U.S. official characterized the issue as lack of agreement on what happens in years 11 to 15. The official spoke on condition of anonymity in line with State Department rules on briefing about the closed-door talks.\r\n\r\nLimits on Irans research and development of centrifuges also were unresolved, the Western officials said.\r\n\r\nTehran has created a prototype centrifuge that it says enriches uranium 16 times faster than its present mainstay model. The U.S. and its partners want to constrain research that would increase greatly the speed of making enough weapons-grade uranium for a bomb, once limits on Irans programs are lifted.\r\n\r\nOne official said Russia opposed the U.S. position that any U.N. penalties lifted in the course of a deal should be reimposed quickly if Tehran reneged on any commitments.\r\n\r\nBoth Western officials said Iran was resisting attempts to make inspections and other ways of verification as intrusive as possible.\r\n\r\nThere was tentative agreement on turning a nearly-finished reactor into a model that gives off less plutonium waste than originally envisaged. Plutonium, like enriched uranium, is a path to nuclear weapons.\r\n\r\nIran and the U.S. were discussing letting Iran run centrifuges at an underground bunker that has been used to enrich uranium. The machines would produce isotopes for peaceful applications, the officials said.\r\n\r\nWith the Tuesday deadline approaching and problems remaining, U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry canceled plans Sunday to return to the United States for an event honoring the late U.S. Sen. Edward Kennedy. French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius and Frank-Walter Steinmeier, his German counterpart, scratched planned trips to Kazakhstan.\r\n\r\nKerry has been in discussions with Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif since Thursday.\r\n\r\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.\r\n\r\nClick for more from The New York Times.',
                    'CEDAR RAPIDS, Iowa â€” â€œI had one of the most wonderful rallies of my entire career right here in 1992,â€ Bill Clinton said by way of opening to the crowd of more than 1,100 on Saturday night.\r\n\r\nTwo days before the Iowa caucuses, Cedar Rapids tried to deliver that same old feeling to his wife, Hillary Clinton.\r\n\r\nIn the crowd,Â one woman held a sign that said â€œ227 years of men. Itâ€™s HER turn!\" Some carried signs and books. Others had traveled from as far as Missouri. They had waited hours, even after the fire marshal told them there was no more room inside the high school gymnasium.\r\n\r\nThe restive crowd chanted slogans and buzzed with anticipation until finally Bill, Hillary and Chelsea Clinton all appeared on stage hand-in-hand, an hour behind schedule. As they roared, Hillary Clinton beamed.\r\n\r\nIt has been a long slog in Iowa for the Clinton campaign, which has struggled mightily to shake the label that its supporters canâ€™t muster the enthusiasm of its rivalâ€™s backers. As the caucuses near, and with the help of a former president, the energy levelÂ at her events are notably dialing up.\r\n\r\n\"Hes a charismatic speaker,\" said Cigi Ross, 31. \"In general, Id say hes a bigger draw for people.\"\r\n\r\nMonday night will put the campaigns months of their work to the test. Can the campaignâ€™s organization bring out their supporters? Can the candidate energize voters?\r\n\r\nClinton, who seemed to draw on the higher-than-usual energy, stood at the center of it all and delivered a confident closing statement.\r\n\r\nâ€œWhat we need is a plan, and a commitment,â€ Clinton said at the top of her voice.\r\n\r\nâ€œAnd me, yes, thank you,â€ Clinton finished.\r\n\r\nEight years later, Clinton is in Iowa once again facing what could be a nail-biting conclusion of a hard-fought campaign. Clinton acknowledges that it isnâ€™t just her campaign that has changed since her devastating loss here in her last run, she too has changed â€” and improved, she told CNN on Saturday.\r\n\r\n\"I think I am a different, and perhaps a better, candidate, so I hope that also shows,\" Clinton said in an interview with the network that morning.\r\n\r\nDays ago, Iowa seemed to be slipping from her grasp, but campaign aides are feeling more confident now. A slew of positive news, endorsements, and the latest poll from the Des Moines Register and Bloomberg News indicate the bleeding has at least slowed. That poll -- considered the gold standard in Iowa -- gave Clinton a slim lead over her rival Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders.\r\n\r\nIf Democrats are wary of political dynasties, they didnâ€™t show it. Spotting someone in the audience carrying Chelsea Clintons book, her father remarked: \"Thank you, young woman, for holding up her book.\"\r\n\r\nBill Clinton, who has spent days crisscrossing the state on his wifes behalf, has settled easily into this role as booster-in-chief. He lays off the policy, leaving that to his wife. He focuses instead on what he knows \"about the job.\"\r\n\r\nâ€œThere are certain, almost intangible qualities that determine whether a president succeeds or not,â€ Clinton said, his voice raspy, even and low. \"You need a sticker. A sticker: someone who wonâ€™t quit on you.â€\r\n\r\n\"Sheâ€™s the best at that Iâ€™ve ever known,â€ he added.',
                    'Donald Trumpâ€™s organizational problems have gone from bad to worse to flat-out embarrassing. Hereâ€™s Politico with the play-by-play from this weekendâ€™s Colorado GOP convention, the latest scene of Trumpâ€™s delegate-securing failure:\r\n\r\nUnlike in most other states, Republicans in Colorado scrapped plans for a more traditional primary or caucus to award its delegates to this summerâ€™s national convention in Cleveland. Instead, the state GOP selected three delegates from each of the stateâ€™s seven congressional districts at individual contests in the days leading up to the state convention, and then the remaining 13 delegates at the statewide event this past weekend. It was a rather convoluted process that favored campaigns that understood the rules and that had the ground game necessary to take advantage of themâ€”or, put another way, not the Trump campaign.\r\n\r\nAt the first two district-level contests, the billionaireâ€™s team showed up without an approved list of delegates to pass out to attendees, leaving supporters unsure of whom to back. And then at last Thursdayâ€™s contest, two of the three delegates on the Trump campaignâ€™s list werenâ€™t actually on the official ballot since they failed to pay the necessary registration fees.\r\n\r\nThis past weekendâ€™s mix-up, though, was an even bigger embarrassment since at least one of the seven misnumbered names on the Trump-sanctioned list lined up with a Cruz-supporting delegate, according to NBC News. (Even without that mix-up, though, Cruz would have likely swept the contest anyway given his well-oiled delegate-selecting machine.) The Trump camp, though, appeared to blame the state GOP for the mistake, pointing to discrepancies between the delegate guides posted on the partys website and the printed materials distributed at the event. â€œWell do whatever it takes to protect the legitimacy of our support in Colorado,â€ Trump aide Alan Cobb told NBC, suggesting the campaign may challenge the results. â€œClearly there are some serious issues with the ballot and balloting.â€\r\n\r\nTrump remains the favorite to arrive at the convention with the most delegates to his name, but heâ€™s far from assured of the majority of delegates heâ€™d need to win the nomination on the first ballot. Given that reality, the GOP front-runner recently retooled his campaign to address his clear weaknesses in the under-the-radar battle to send loyal delegates to the convention. If those efforts dont start paying dividends soon, though, Trump very well may arrive in Cleveland with the most delegatesâ€”and leave without the nomination.',

                    'As more women move into high offices,Â they often bring a style and approach that is distinct from men. But do they make better leaders?\r\n\r\nDemocratic women of the US Senate stand on stage during the final night of the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia (top). There are 20 women in the Senate â€“ 14 Democrats and six Republicans.\r\n\r\nKelly Ayotte and Joni Ernst take the floor, two dynamic young US senators before a town hall of older military veterans. Between them, they represent a raft of firsts: Senator Ayotte is New Hampshireâ€™s first female attorney general and first female Republican senator. Senator Ernst is Iowaâ€™s first woman ever elected to either house of Congress and the first female military veteran to serve in the Senate.\r\n\r\nThe gender dimension does not go unnoticed. Please welcome â€œour beautiful senators,â€ says the veteran who introduces them. Ayotte mentions Ernstâ€™s military service â€“ sheâ€™s also a war veteran. But in most ways, the woman thing doesnâ€™t matter. This is just like any other political town hall in campaign season â€“ one senator trying to help another whoâ€™s locked in a tight reelection race.\r\n\r\nYet the stakes are high. Republican control of the US Senate could hinge on Ayotteâ€™s ability to fend off her Democratic challenger, Gov. Maggie Hassan. And across the country, women figure prominently in the Democratsâ€™ strategy to retake the Senate, nominating women in six of the 11 competitive races.\r\n\r\nThen thereâ€™s Hillary Clinton, the first woman to win a major partyâ€™s presidential nomination in the United States.\r\n\r\nItâ€™s enough to call 2016 Year of the Woman 2.0, following the original, 1992, when female representation in the Senate jumped from two to six. Today, female senators number 20 out of 100, with potential to reach 24, depending on how the political winds are blowing by Election Day.\r\n\r\nGender diversity among major world powers is also rising, with the ascension of Theresa May to the British prime ministership. If Mrs. Clinton wins in November, three of the worldâ€™s top five economies will be headed by women. (German Chancellor Angela Merkel is the other.)\r\n\r\nBut the numbers and the â€œfirstsâ€ invite a deeper question: Do women really lead differently? From the halls of government to corporate boardrooms, itâ€™s a burning question.\r\n\r\nâ€œI think weâ€™re good listeners, and I think that helps,â€ says Ayotte in an interview. â€œI donâ€™t want to say my male colleagues arenâ€™t, because plenty of them are. But I think that we listen, and so weâ€™re picking up on where we see the common ground with other people.â€\r\n\r\nOn that point, there is bipartisan agreement.\r\n\r\nâ€œThere is good research that shows women tend to have different leadership styles,â€ Democratic Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, New Hampshireâ€™s other senator, says in an interview. â€œWe tend to be more inclusive, weâ€™re less autocratic in our decisionmaking. We like consensus, we like to get people around the table, and so I think that has made a difference.â€\r\n\r\nOf course, thereâ€™s also the example of Rep. Nancy Pelosi (D) of California, the first woman speaker of the House (2007-11). During her tenure, she was known for her ability to wield power â€“ and in a highly partisan way. More than with previous speakers, major legislation came out of her office, not the committees. She was (and is) a master fundraiser for Democrats writ large, a skill she has used to great effect in keeping her members in line.\r\n\r\nAnd as a Roman Catholic woman, Congresswoman Pelosi demonstrated at a crucial moment the power of networking. In 2010, when House passage of the Affordable Care Act appeared in doubt over the abortion issue, she tapped connections her male colleagues had never heard of â€“ two associations of nuns, whose support for the bill proved pivotal.\r\n\r\nThe research on womenâ€™s leadership style has been extensive â€“ and mixed. One academic study, released in 2013, found that women are more attracted to cooperation than men. The reason is that men tend to have greater confidence in their abilities, while women tend to be more optimistic about their prospective teammatesâ€™ abilities, according to the study by Peter Kuhn and Marie-Claire Villeval.\r\n\r\nNew research, released in August, looked specifically at gender differences in the US House of Representatives and found â€œlittle evidence to suggest women are inherently more cooperative or bipartisan.â€ The only difference came with Republican women, who tend to recruit more cosponsors on legislation, including more from the opposite party. That tendency was most pronounced on so-called womenâ€™s issues, such as education and social welfare.\r\n\r\nâ€œWe interpret these results as evidence that cooperation is mostly driven by a commonality of interest, rather than gender per se,â€ write the authors, Stefano Gagliarducci and M. Daniele Paserman.\r\n\r\nThe study examined 20 years of data ending in 2008. Since then, female representation in Congress has ticked up a notch, reaching 20 percent in the Senate and nearly that in the House â€“ the rough threshold for a perceived â€œcritical massâ€ of representation in which women can show perceptible influence.\r\n\r\nIndeed, since 2013, female legislators point to multiple examples of how the women of the Senate, in particular, have been instrumental in breaking through congressional gridlock. The best-known example is the end of the 2013 government shutdown, when women senators from both parties met privately over dinner and fashioned a compromise that would form the nucleus of the final deal.\r\n\r\nMore recently, the women of the Senate â€“ all 20 of them, dubbed â€œthe sisterhoodâ€ â€“ backed landmark legislation aimed at combating sex trafficking, which President Obama signed into law in May 2015.\r\n\r\nWhen asked for other examples, Senator Shaheen cites the 2013 reauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act. â€œIt was considered dead,â€ she says, â€œand because all the women [senators] got on board and pushed it, we were able to get it through.â€\r\n\r\nShaheen also notes the growing number of women who serve in top spots on committees, such as the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, with Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R) of Alaska as chair and Sen. Maria Cantwell (D) of Washington as the ranking member. â€œIt looks like we may get an energy bill done this year, and I think that speaks to their ability to work together, and to be flexible, and move our colleagues in the House,â€ Shaheen says.\r\n\r\nBehind all this female power are the women senatorsâ€™ regular dinners, a chance to kick back and talk about whatever â€“ their lives, their work, their male colleagues.\r\n\r\nâ€œWe go by Mikulskiâ€™s rules â€“ that what happens in those dinners stays in those dinners,â€ says Shaheen, referring to Sen. Barbara Mikulski (D) of Maryland, the longest-serving woman in congressional history, who is about to retire. â€œBut yeah, theyâ€™ve proved to be a great opportunity to build relationships.â€\r\n\r\nAs it happens, Shaheen had hosted 12 of her female colleagues the night before at her office. On the menu: lobsters and clam chowder. That much she will reveal. Sen. Susan Collins (R) of Maine was there, Shaheen says, â€œand we had a back and forth about whether the lobsters came from Maine or New Hampshire.â€\r\n\r\nIn 2013, after the Senateâ€™s 20 women helped end the government shutdown, Sen. John McCain (R) of Arizona wondered out loud: â€œImagine what they could do if there were 50 of them.â€\r\n\r\nThat may sound logical, but the reality isnâ€™t so simple. While women do bring a distinctive perspective to policy, based on their life experiences, that doesnâ€™t necessarily make them less partisan, experts say. Some of the most polarizing issues are so-called womenâ€™s issues, including health care, abortion, and equal pay.\r\n\r\nâ€œAs long as womenâ€™s issues constitute a prominent division between the parties, there will be little bipartisan collaboration among women on these policies,â€ Michele Swers, a political scientist at Georgetown University, wrote in The Washington Post in 2014.\r\n\r\nMs. Swers also notes that partisan sorting has made the South â€“ a region less hospitable to women candidates â€“ the stronghold of the Republican Party, while the more moderate brand of Republicanism that predominates in parts of the country more willing to elect women has declined.\r\n\r\nAnd because women tend to occupy the â€œleftward wingâ€ of their respective parties, Democratic women in particular are less inclined to compromise, the Gagliarducci-Paserman study found.\r\n\r\nStill, none of this means women shouldnâ€™t be more rigorously recruited for public office, say leaders of both parties.\r\n\r\nâ€œWhat you need is more good people, and the process of excluding women has excluded good people from service,â€ says former Gov. John Sununu (R) of New Hampshire. â€œSo what you need to do is level the playing field.â€\r\n\r\nIn the business world, boosting female representation on corporate boards â€“ now near 20 percent â€“ has been a long-held goal. Advocates cite benefits to the bottom line. In a famous study, Catalyst Inc., a nonprofit that promotes women leaders in the workplace, found that corporate boards with the highest female representation attained â€œsignificantly higher financial performanceâ€ than those with the lowest representation.\r\n\r\nBut whether in the private sector or in government, women as top executives are even rarer than women legislators. Only six of the nationâ€™s 50 governors are women, three Republicans and three Democrats. Among world leaders, fewer than two dozen are female. Among Fortune 500 companies, only 21 chief executive officers â€“ or 4.2 percent â€“ are women.\r\n\r\nWhile legislating is an inherently collaborative process, and therefore seems to play to womenâ€',

                    '0 \r\nHillary Clinton has barely just lost the presidential election and here she is already getting herself caught in another one of her tangled web of lies. \r\nThe day after losing, a picture was posted of her taking her dog out for a walk. The picture was reportedly from a random hiker she ran into and showed that she was getting back to public life, or thatâ€™s what she wants you to believe. \r\nNow, I want you to do me a favor and take a very close look at this picture, specifically the â€œhikerâ€ she met. Memorize her faceâ€¦ \r\nGot it? Okay, good. \r\nNow what I am about to show you is something Hillary Clinton was hoping nobody else would notice. Tell me if the girl in the 2nd picture, taken in the 2000â€™s, reminds you of anyone: \r\nYeah, it is the EXACT SAME GIRL! \r\nHer name is Margot Gerster and her mother just happens to be one of the big fundraisers for Hillary. Thatâ€™s actually where the older picture was taken. \r\nWow! That doesnâ€™t seem random at all, does it? \r\nIt looks like this is yet another example of Hillary Clinton trying to mislead the public using her inner circle and pretending like she doesnâ€™t know them. \r\nAll I gotta say is, give it the Hell up, Hillary!

                    'Washington (CNN) For months, the White House and Congress have wrangled over a bill that would give lawmakers a greater say in the Iran nuclear deal the administration is hammering out along with other world powers.\r\n\r\nAnd now, less than two weeks after a framework agreement with Tehran was reached, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee is planning to take up the measure.\r\n\r\nOn Tuesday, the committee will consider amendments to Tennessee Republican Sen. Bob Corkers Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act before deciding whether to have the full Senate vote on it.\r\n\r\nFor many in Congress, its a very simple premise: Congress should weigh in on the terms of a final nuclear deal with Iran.\r\n\r\nBut for the White House, and some Democrats in Congress, thats an explosive idea that could derail the talks â€” and therefore must be stopped.\r\n\r\nSo whats in the bill?\r\n\r\nSupporters of the legislation have emphasized that it would allow Congress to give a thumbs up or down on the deal President Barack Obama is aiming to finalize with Iran by the negotiations June 30 deadline. Backers think thats only fair since the United States is contemplating a major nuclear pact with a decadeslong enemy.\r\n\r\nThe bill would give Congress a chance to hold hearings, host briefings and pave the way to a vote on a joint resolution that could express approval or disapproval of the deal. It also requires the Obama administration to quickly report to Congress on details of the deal and regularly assess whether Iran is keeping its commitments. And it spells out what the President needs to do vis-a-vis Congress if Iran is found violating the terms.\r\n\r\nBut most important, it would keep Obama from waiving any congressional sanctions on Iran during Congress 60-day review period. And if Congress passes a joint resolution of disapproval, then sanctions could not be lifted even after that time.\r\n\r\nDoes this hurt the diplomatic effort to reach a final deal?\r\n\r\nIrans primary reason for agreeing to the deals limits on its nuclear program is to get sanctions relief.\r\n\r\nIranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei and President Hassan Rouhani have insisted sanctions must be lifted on Day One of the deal. While the Obama administration has said it would wait several months before lifting sanctions -- to verify that Iran has taken major steps to roll back its program â€” the President is counting on having some latitude to waive sanctions in order to give Iran an incentive to sign the deal and then keep its commitments.\r\n\r\nThe Corker bill makes it less likely sanctions would be lifted, and lifted in a timely way, which gives less encouragement to Iran.\r\n\r\nWithout the bill, could Obama lift all sanctions on Iran?\r\n\r\nNot all, but most â€” at least for a limited time.\r\n\r\nWithout the Corker-Menendez bill (named after Corker and lead Democratic co-sponsor Sen. Bob Menendez), Iran could see nearly all nuclear-related sanctions at least temporarily lifted. Those enacted through the United Nations and by presidential executive order could be fully removed, and most of those passed by Congress could be waived by Obama until he leaves office, when they would go back into effect unless the next president continues to waive them.\r\n\r\nIf the Corker-Menendez bill becomes law and a deal is finalized, Obama wouldnt be able to lift the congressional sanctions for at least 60 days.\r\n\r\nDuring that 60-day review phase, the bill says Obama cant \"waive, suspend, reduce, provide relief from, or otherwise limit the application of statutory sanctions.\"\r\n\r\nHow can Obama waive sanctions passed by Congress anyway?\r\n\r\nThe biggest sanctions package approved by Congress, widely credited with crippling Irans economy and bringing the country to the negotiating table, was the 2010 Comprehensive Iran Sanctions, Accountability, and Divestment Act.\r\n\r\nIt included a provision that gives the President leverage to waive sanctions for a limited time if he determines its in the U.S. national security interest.\r\n\r\nHe wouldnt be able to permanently sunset the sanctions, though, unless Iran cuts its ties with and stops funding terror organizations around the world, an aspect not being addressed in the current negotiations with Iran and not predicted to happen any time soon.\r\n\r\nThe administration says sanctions are where Congress could eventually weigh in on the Iran deal -- by repealing them -- but that would only happen if lawmakers deem the deal a good one.\r\n\r\nHow would Congress weigh in during the 60-day review period?\r\n\r\nCongress could pass a joint resolution approving of the deal or disapproving of the deal and forbidding any sanctions relief. Or it could do nothing, allowing Obama to implement the sanctions, and by implication the deal, after the 60 days are up.\r\n\r\nA joint resolution disapproving of the deal would need to muster a two-thirds majority, though, to override the veto Obama has promised -- an unlikely, but not entirely unthinkable, scenario.\r\n\r\nAre there other reasons that Obama opposes this bill?\r\n\r\nFirst, hes facing a combative, Republican majority in both houses of Congress. Those Republicans have sought to undermine his negotiations with Iran at every turn. Giving those lawmakers a legislative avenue to slam the terms of an eventual deal would, at best, be a political blow to Obama and his administrations efforts to broker an agreement.\r\n\r\nTheres also the White Houses argument that the executive branch has the power to broker international agreements without Congress meddling, while congressional oversight of the Iran deal would set a dangerous precedent. Most international agreements arent treaties ratified by Congress, and Obama has argued that U.S. allies need to know they can count on those agreements holding up.\r\n\r\nVirtually every Senate Republican supports the bill and nine Democrats have signed on as co-sponsors, including independent Sen. Angus King, who caucuses with Democrats. Several more on the left are leaning toward supporting the bill.\r\n\r\nThat means backers will likely pass the bill with a filibuster-proof majority. Its unclear, though, if they can muster enough Democrats willing to vote to override Obamas veto.\r\n\r\nIts not just the numbers, though. Some powerful Democrats are supporting the legislation. Sen. Chuck Schumer of New York, the No. 3 Senate Democrat, who will become the chambers Democratic leader when Minority Leader Harry Reid of Nevada retires at the end of his term, is a big proponent of the legislation.\r\n\r\nMenendez, of New Jersey, who has been working to rally Democrats around legislation on Iran throughout the negotiations, remains the most vocal Democrat on the issue. He was the top-ranked Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee until stepping aside to face corruption charges handed down earlier in the month.\r\n\r\nAlso, Sen. Tim Kaine of Virginia, one of the earliest Obama backers during the 2008 campaign, has been insistent on the need for Congress to weigh in and has worked behind the scenes to make Corkers bill more palatable to Democrats -- and the White House. But so far that effort hasnt succeeded, as the White House remains opposed.',
                    'While paging through Pews best data visualizations of 2014 (its awesome), I came across what I believe to be one of the best and most revealing charts about the state of American politics. Here it is:\r\n\r\nThe chart, which comes from Pews amazing political polarization project, shows how partisans of both parties have grown both increasingly unified amongst themselvesÂ and increasingly far apart from their partisan others over just the last 20 years. As recently as 1994, seven in 10 Democrats were more consistently liberal than the median Republican. Â As of 2014, its a whopping 94 percent. Same goes for Republicans; 64 percent of GOPers were more consistently conservative than the median Democrat in 1994 while 92 percent are today. In addition, \"the overall share of Americans who express consistently conservative or consistently liberal opinions has doubled over the past two decades from 10 percent to 21 percent,\" according to Pew.\r\n\r\nTo me, this chart is so important -- particularly in a week where a new Congress arrives in Washington -- because it reveals that the polarization of our elected officials isnt some sort of \"only in Washington\" thing. Â The increasing partisanship of Congress is a direct reflection of the increasing partisanship of the country. After all, thats who elects these people to Congress, right?\r\n\r\nSo, when you hear people decry the partisanship of their elected officials in Washington, dont believe it. Â We have the Congress we want -- even if we arent totally honest with ourselves all the time about what that is. Â And, we get the results -- not many -- from our elected officials that you have to expect when you have a country as polarized as ours.',
                    'With little fanfare this fall, the New York developer who had planned to build an Islamic community center north of the World Trade Center announced that he would instead use the site for a 70-story tower of luxury condos.\r\n\r\nThose who had rallied in opposition to the building because of its religious affiliation back in 2010 were exultant. â€œThe importance of the defeat of the Ground Zero Mosque cannot be overstated,â€ Pamela Geller, president of the American Freedom Defense Initiative, wrote on the website Breitbart in September. â€œThe Ground Zero Mosque became a watershed issue in our effort to raise awareness of and ultimately halt and roll back the advance of Islamic law and Islamic supremacism in America.â€\r\n\r\nItâ€™s all well and good that so many Republicans have condemned Donald Trumpâ€™s reprehensible call for â€œa total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States.â€ House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (Wis.) was particularly forceful, calling proper attention to the â€œmany Muslims serving in our armed forces, dying for this country.â€\r\n\r\nWhen he was president, George W. Bush honorably put a lid on right-wing Islamophobia. He regularly praised American Muslims and stressed that the United States needed Muslim allies to fight violent extremism. Once Bush was gone, restraint on his side of politics fell away.\r\n\r\nThus, Trumpâ€™s embrace of a religious test for entry to our country did not come out of nowhere. On the contrary, it simply brought us to the bottom of a slippery slope created by the ongoing exploitation of anti-Muslim feeling for political purposes.\r\n\r\nYou donâ€™t have to reach far back in time to see why Trump figured he had the ideological space for his Muslim ban. Last month, it was Jeb Bush who introduced the idea of linking the rights of Syrian refugees to their religion. He said he was comfortable granting admission to â€œpeople like orphans and people who are clearly not going to be terrorists. Or Christians.â€ Asked how heâ€™d determine who was Christian, he explained that â€œyou can prove youâ€™re a Christian.â€\r\n\r\nSen. Ted Cruz (Tex.) took a similar view, saying , â€œThere is no meaningful risk of Christians committing acts of terror.â€\r\n\r\nTrump took limits on Muslim access to our country to their logical â€” if un-American and odious â€” conclusion. Vice President Biden said that Trump was serving up â€œa very, very dangerous brew,â€ but the brew has been steeping for a long time. This is why the â€œGround Zero Mosqueâ€ episode is so instructive.\r\n\r\nThe demagoguery began with the labeling of the controversy itself. As PolitiFact pointed out, â€œthe proposed mosque is not at or on Ground Zero. It does not directly abut it or overlook it.â€ It was â€œtwo long blocksâ€ away. And while a mosque was part of the proposed cultural center, the plans also included â€œa swimming pool, gym and basketball court, a 500-seat auditorium, a restaurant and culinary school, a library and art studios.â€\r\n\r\nThis didnâ€™t stop opponents from going over the top, and Newt Gingrich deserved some kind of award for the most incendiary comment of all. â€œNazis,â€ he said, â€œdonâ€™t have the right to put up a sign next to the Holocaust museum in Washington.â€\r\n\r\nWhen President Obama defended the right of developers to build the project, he was â€” surprise, surprise â€” accused of being out of touch, and Republicans were happy to make the Muslim center and Obamaâ€™s defense of religious rights an issue in the 2010 campaign.\r\n\r\nâ€œI think it does speak to the lack of connection between the administration and Washington and folks inside the Beltway and mainstream America,â€ said Sen. John Cornyn (Tex.), who was then chairman of the committee in charge of electing Republicans to the Senate. Voters, he said, felt they were â€œbeing lectured to, not listened to.â€ Sound familiar?\r\n\r\nAt the time, John Feehery, the veteran Republican strategist, put his finger on why Republicans were so eager to lambaste Obamaâ€™s response to the Ground Zero issue. â€œThis will help drive turnout for the GOP base,â€ he said.\r\n\r\nThe Republican establishment is now all upset with Trump, but he is simply the revenge of a Republican base that took its leadersâ€™ pandering â€” on Islam and a host of other issues â€” seriously.\r\n\r\nYou canâ€™t be â€œjust a littleâ€ intolerant of Muslims, any more than you can be â€œjust a littleâ€ prejudiced against Catholics or Jews. Once the door to bigotry is opened, it is very hard to shut.\r\n\r\nRead more from E.J. Dionneâ€™s archive, follow him on Twitter or subscribe to his updates on Facebook.',

                    'Hillary Clinton told a Staten Island crowd today that she was the candidate who could reach acrossÂ party lines to get things done as presidentâ€”pointing to her experience representing the borough in the Senate and even giving public thanks to Republican President George W. Bush.\r\n\r\nâ€œIÂ have no time for people who are partisan for the sake of being partisan,â€ Ms. Clinton, a Democrat and former secretary of state, told a crowd that welcomed her enthusiastically in a historic building at Snug Harbor Cultural Center.\r\n\r\nMs. Clinton was the second leading presidential candidate to speak on Staten Island today, after Republican Donald Trump delivered a typical stump speech at a Republican brunch. But Ms. Clinton, perhaps sensing or recalling Staten Islandâ€™s ever-present desire for politicians to pay attention to the forgotten borough, delivered a speech that seemed to be especially tailored for the borough, which is more conservative than the rest of New York City. The majority of its voters are registered Democrats, but the borough routinely swings Republican.\r\n\r\nâ€œWhen IÂ ran in 2000, IÂ didnâ€™t carry Staten Island. When IÂ ran in 2006, IÂ did,â€ Ms. Clinton said today. â€œIâ€™ve got no problemÂ with people having political disagreements. Thatâ€™s in Americaâ€™s DNA,Â isnâ€™t it?â€\r\n\r\nInstead, Ms. Clinton decried â€œdeliberate efforts to set Americans against each other.â€ She harkened back to representing the borough of cops and firefightersÂ onÂ September 11, 20001,Â when nearly 300 Staten Islanders were killed in the terror attacks. She noted the cityâ€™s mayor, the stateâ€™s governor, and the president were all Republicans.\r\n\r\nâ€œIÂ did not for one minute stop and say to myself: â€˜Well, IÂ donâ€™t know, can we work together?â€ Ms. Clinton said. â€œHow absurd is that?â€\r\n\r\nMs. Clinton said with 3,000 people murdered, people â€œpulled togetherâ€ and â€œpolitics was totally left behind.â€ She had criticized President Bush for his handling of a strong economy he â€œinheritedâ€ from her husband, President Bill Clinton, and for other reasons. But she praised him for approving billions of dollars to rebuild lower Manhattan after the terror attacks, even as others in Washington didnâ€™t want to spend it.\r\n\r\nâ€œI publicly say, â€˜Thank you President George W.Â Bush,â€™ for making sure that we got the money that we needed to rebuild our city,â€ Ms. Clinton said.\r\n\r\nShe also touted her record working for the borough after the attacks, including sounding the alarm on air quality and pushing for the passage of the Zadroga Act. Ms. Clinton went on to discuss her foreign policy experience, saying anyone who wants to president has to be able to offer specifics on what they would doâ€”an allusion to her Democratic rival Vermont Sen. Bernie Sandersâ€”but also has to be able to keep people safe.\r\n\r\nâ€œMaybe we take that more seriously hereÂ in New York, but we should,â€ she said. â€œAnd we are going to do everything we can to keep America safe.â€\r\n\r\nSheÂ cited her work building a coalition that â€œbrought Iran to the negotiating table,â€ without mentioning how controversial that final Iran deal was for President Barack Obama.\r\n\r\nMs. Clintonâ€™s rally had little in common with Mr. Trumpâ€™s Staten Island event, except one thing: the crowd at both seemed to hate Republican Texas Sen. Ted Cruz. Ms. Clinton mentioned his plan to spy onÂ Muslim neighborhoods, which has also been dismissed by Police Commissioner Bill Bratton.\r\n\r\nAt the mention of Mr. Cruzâ€™s name, the crowd offered a chorus of boos.\r\n\r\nThe crowd had been hypedÂ upÂ for Ms. Clinton before she even arrived, and gave a nice response to several local pols as they urged peopleÂ to get out the vote on Tuesday.\r\n\r\nâ€œHillary is the only one with the experience,â€ said Councilwoman Debi Rose, a Democrat who represents the boroughâ€™s North Shore.Â â€œShe knows what itâ€™s like to be in the White House. She knows the realities. She knows that living and running the White House in this country is not a reality show.â€\r\n\r\nMs. Clinton, at the end of her speech, offered the kind of promise Staten Island always lovesâ€”and the kind it holds politicians to, if the way the Staten Island AdvanceÂ repeatedly agitated and inquired about a town hallÂ Mayor Bill de Blasio will finally hold here on Wednesday night isÂ any indication.\r\n\r\nâ€œIÂ want you to hold me accountable,â€ Ms. Clinton said. â€œIÂ will be coming back to Staten Island when I am your president.â€',
